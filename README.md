# GoCast

Gocast is a tool that does controller BGP route advertisements from a host. It runs custom defined healthchecks and
announces or withdraws routes (most commonly VIPs or Virtual IPs) to a BGP peer.
The most common use case for this is anycast (vip) based load balancing for infrastructure services such as DNS, Syslog
etc where several instances are available in geographically diverse regions that announce the same anycast VIP, and
clients then get sent to the closest instance.

## Installation

Use the docker container at mayuresh82/gocast or compile from source:

1. [Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
2. [Setup your GOPATH](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH)
3. Run `go get -d github.com/mayuresh82/gocast`
4. Run `cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/mayuresh82/gocast`
5. Run `make`

## Design

GoCast uses [GoBGP](https://github.com/osrg/gobgp) as a library to peer with remote neighbors and announce/withdraw
prefixes. It really is just a healthcheck based wrapper around GoBGP. Remote peers can be autodiscovered or statically
configured. A peer will most commonly be a Top-Of-Rack (TOR) switch.

Typically you would run GoCast on the same hosts as the service that needs to be monitored.
Once an application "registers" with GoCast, GoCast then runs the predefined health monitors/checks and if they fail (
e.g a service listening on a specific port), the routes are withdrawn thereby taking the node out of service.

GoCast uses a config file to define agent parameters (http addr, consul server addr, timers etc) and BGP parameters (
local/peer ASN, peer IP, origin/communnities). See example config.yaml.

### Registration

An application can register with the GoCast instance running on the same host using one of the following methods:

1. http call : Make an http get call with the required parameters. For example:

```
http://gocast-addr/register?name=<appName>&vip=<addr/mask>&monitor=port:tcp:5000
```

Multiple monitors can be defined and the healthcheck succeeds only when all the monitors pass.

2. Custom defined apps in config.yaml. See the example config.yaml for syntax examples

3. Consul based auto-discovery (see below)

## Monitors

A health monitor can either be a port monitor, an exec monitor or consul. Port monitors are specified as *port:protocol:
portnum* , exec monitors run a script or arbitrary command and pass on successful exit (status code 0), specified as
*exec:command* and consul monitors use consul's own healthchecks, specifed simply as *consul*

## Consul Integration

GoCast supports consul for automatic service discovery and healthchecking. For this to work, the following needs to be
setup:

- The host running GoCast needs to have the environment variable **CONSUL_NODE** set to the hostname in consul

- The following tags must be set in consul for autodiscovery to work:

`enable_gocast` : required

`gocast_vip=<addr/mask>`: required

`gocast_monitor=monitor:params`: optional

If `gocast_monitor=consul` is specified, then GoCast uses the defined healthchecks in consul as the health monitors for
the service.

If `gocast_nat=protocol:listenPort:destinationPort` is specified, then GoCast will create NAT rules, via iptables, and
map traffic destined to the assigned VIP and the specified `listenPort` to the physical IP and `destinationPort`.

Example: `gocast_nat=tcp:53:8053` and `gocast_nat=udp:53:8053`

Alternatively, if `gocast_nat=protocol:port` is specified, then GoCast will create NAT rules, via iptables, and map
traffic destined to the assigned VIP and the specified `port` to the physical IP and `port`.

Example: `gocast_nat=tcp:53` and `gocast_nat=udp:53`

## Nomad Integration

GoCast supports nomad for automatic service discovery. For this to work, it must be configured in the config file and
the nomad services need to have a couple tags.

### Configuration

```yaml
agent:
  # required for nomad integration to work, address where the nomad API can be reached
  nomad_addr: http://127.0.0.1:4646/
  # optional, if omitted, doesn't send explicit namespace to nomad 
  # (nomad itself currently defaults to the "default" namespace)
  nomad_namespace: "*"
  # required for nomad integration to work, node ID
  nomad_node: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  # optional, include if nomad API requires authentication
  nomad_token: "token-value"
  # optional, specify if the query interval should be changed (default 30 seconds)
  nomad_query_interval: 30s
```

### Tags

## Docker support

The docker image at mayuresh82/gocast can be used to run GoCast inside a container. In order for GoCast to manipulate
the host network stack correctly, the container needs to run with NET_ADMIN capablity and host mode networking. For
example:

```
docker run -d --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --net=host -v /path/to/host-config:/path/to/container-config mayuresh82/gocast -config=/path/to/config.yaml -logtostderr
```

**Caveats and workarounds**

The service to be monitored can also be run inside a container, provided the published service ports are set to listen
on 0.0.0.0 (not a specific IP.)
Certain orchestration solutions such as Nomad run the docker containers with published ports listening only on the
physical IP address. This will cause all requests to the app to fail, because the host does not listen on the loopback
interface any more (which GoCast uses and assigns the VIP IP to). To work=around this there are 2 options:

- Start the service container in host networking mode OR

- Register NAT rules for your service with GoCast for the required protocol/port(s). GoCast will then create iptables
  NAT rules that map traffic destined to the assigned VIP to the physical IP address. This is achieved by adding the
  `nat=protocol:listenPort:destinationPort` in the http query or `gocast_nat=protocol:listenPort:destinationPort` tag(s)
  in consul, as shown in the Consul integration section above.

**Why not just use ExaBGP or something similar ?**

ExaBGP is commonly used for this purpose, with bash scripts and such. However, I found that there no standard way of
doing things and there is little to no support for containerized services. Also ExaBGP's API is clunky and documentation
is almost non existent. GoCast provides an out of the box solution without hacking together a bunch of scripts.
